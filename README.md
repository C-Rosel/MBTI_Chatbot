# Athena: MBTI Chatbot

Athena is a twist on the traditional, popular Myer-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality assessment that is widely used in schools and the corporate world. Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Athena engages users in natural conversation and predicts the four MBTI dichotomies based on linguistic patterns observed in user dialogue.
